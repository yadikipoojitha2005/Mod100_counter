The mod100 module is a synchronous counter that counts from 0 to 99, then resets back to 0. It can be used in digital designs where a modulo-100 counting operation is required, such as timer divisions, frequency counters, or BCD-based counters.

Features
Counts sequentially from 0 to 99.
Resets automatically to 0 after reaching 99.
Asynchronous active-low reset (rst).

7-bit output to represent values up to 99.
